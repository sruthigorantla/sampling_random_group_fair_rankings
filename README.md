# sampling_random_group_fair_rankings
code for the algorithm in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00887.pdf


# input to the code
is described in random_walk_ranker.py
A dummy data is also created in the main function.

# The code uses
the polytope sampler from https://github.com/ConstrainedSampler/PolytopeSamplerMatlab
